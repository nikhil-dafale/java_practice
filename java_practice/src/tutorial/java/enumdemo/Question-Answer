enum:

Q. What is enum?
- Special type of class which provide support to add group of constant.

Q. Why enum called as special class?
- internally java compiler treat enum as class. 
- Whatever implementation we can achieve using class concept we can do the same in enum also with group of constants.

Q. Whats the part of enum in inheritance?
- by default enum is final, so cannot extends by any other class
- by default extends java.lang.Enum class, so cannot extends another class.
- so inheritance is already managed. but no other class can it's sub class or super class.

Q. Write internal implementation of enum for following example.
1.
enum Level {
	LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
}

2.
public enum Food {
	HAMBURGER(7), FRIES(2), HOTDOG(3), ARTICHOKE(4);
}

Q. How to access enum constants?
- by enum name because every enum constants are static.

Q. Can we create methods inside enums?
- Yes.
- We can create static and not-static enums inside enum
- Even we can create main method inside enum, so we can consider enum as base/main class of our program (but this is not recommended)
